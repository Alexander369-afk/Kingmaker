RAW Swordsaint Magus Kingmaker at lvl 5 with -1 spell should have 2 lvl 2 spell slots at lvl 5 with int 18. Calculation = 2 spells pr day +1 from int -1 from diminished spellcasting. I got 1 at lvl 5, thats why i hard fix lvl 5 and see what happens.

We cant find diminished spellcasting using dnspy. Thats why we proceed to change Spell progression accordingly. 



Based on the information from how spells are implemented
