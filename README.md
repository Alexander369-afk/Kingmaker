RAW Swordsaint Magus Kingmaker at lvl 5 should have  2 lvl 2 spell slots at lvl 5 with int 18. Calculation = 2 spells pr day +1 from int -1 from diminished spellcasting. I got 1 at lvl 5. 

The blueprint for Swordsaint is wrong. Not adding +1 at 5, but instead adding +1 at 7 when it shouldnt. This means you get a delayed LVL 2 spell slot, and this is the bug. 

We cant find diminished spellcasting using dnspy. I suspect Swordsaint got its own table to handle diminished spellcasting.
